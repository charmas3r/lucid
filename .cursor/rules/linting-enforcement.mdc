      ### Linting Best Practices
      - **Automatic Linting**: Always ensure that ESLint and Prettier are configured correctly.
      - **Pre-commit Checks**: Encourage the use of `husky` and `lint-staged` to catch errors before they reach the repository.
      - **Fix Lint Errors**: If you encounter linting errors or warnings, prioritize fixing them before proceeding with new feature development.
      - **Rules Adherence**:
        - No unused variables (`no-unused-vars`).
        - Enforce consistent import ordering (`eslint-plugin-import`).
        - Prefer `const` over `let` when possible.

      ### Workflow
      - Run `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` frequently during development.
      - In Cursor, pay attention to the linter feedback and use the `read_lints` tool after making significant changes.

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad (Unused variable, let instead of const)
      let x = 10;
      const result = fetchData();

      // Good
      const result = await fetchData();
      console.log(result);
    output: "Follows linting and quality standards"
